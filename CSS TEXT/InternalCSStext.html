<!-- Internal stylesheets appear in the <head> section of an HTML document. The CSS itself will appear within
a <style> element. This is advantageous because all the CSS is in one location and easily editable. Perhaps,
more importantly, CSS style rules can be applied to multiple elements, unlike in the case of inline CSS. -->

<h1> Skateboarding </h1>
<h2> Skateboarding is an activity that involves using a skateboard to ride. </h2>
<p>In the United States skateboarding began when surfers were looking for an activity or sport to enjoy when the waves were unsuitable for surfing. It is not known who made the first skateboard, early skateboards looked like surf boards on wheels.</p>
<p>The bottom of the skateboard deck is the most popular place for skateboarders to personalize. They do not wear jerseys or uniforms usually and use the bottom of the deck to express their personality with graphics and logos or sayings.</p>
