<p>In the United States skateboarding began when surfers were looking for an activity or sport to enjoy when the waves were unsuitable for surfing. It is not known who made the first skateboard, early skateboards looked like surf boards on wheels.</p>
<p>The bottom of the skateboard deck is the most popular place for skateboarders to personalize. They do not wear jerseys or uniforms usually and use the bottom of the deck to express their personality with graphics and logos or sayings.</p>
