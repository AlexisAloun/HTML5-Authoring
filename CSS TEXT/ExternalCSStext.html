<!-- External style sheets appear in their own file and are attached to the HTML document using the <link>
tag.
External Style Sheets are often the preferred method of placing CSS because the document can be applied
to multiple HTML files giving related documents consistent styling and allowing style changes across
multiple pages to be completed with a single edit.
An external style sheet should be saved with the .css file extension -->
<html>

<head>
<title> Example External CSS TEXT </title>
<link href="ExternaltextCSS.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

<!-- There are a couple of things to note here about the <link> tag. First the href attribute should point to
the path and filename for your CSS. In the case above the CSS appears in the same folder as the HTML. The
rel attribute and the type attribute always appear as shown here and are required. -->

<h1> Skateboarding </h1>
<h2> Skateboarding is an action sport that involves performing tricks using a skateboard. </h2>
<p>In the United States skateboarding began when surfers were looking for an activity or sport to enjoy when the waves were unsuitable for surfing. It is not known who made the first skateboard, early skateboards looked like surf boards on wheels.</p>
<p>The bottom of the skateboard deck is the most popular place for skateboarders to personalize. They do not wear jerseys or uniforms usually and use the bottom of the deck to express their personality with graphics and logos or sayings.</p>
