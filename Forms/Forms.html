<!-- The form tag declares our form in the document. -->
<!-- There are two important attributes for the form tag: action and method. -->
<!-- The action attribute is used to specify where to send the form data once the form is submitted.
The action target is typically a back-end script written in a server-side language addressable via a URL.
Since we’re not learning back-end languages, we'll add a # sign for now.-->
	<form action=”#” method=”post”>
<!-- The method attribute is related
to the request type of the form.
The most common two are get and post requests.
Forms with the get method append
the data submitted through them to the URL of the
action attribute.
When the form passes to the server,
the URL is visible in the browser’s address bar.
The post method is used more frequently. With
post, the form values are sent to the processor
as part of the HTTP header and not visible in the
browser -->
		<label for="userName">Full Name</label>
        <!-- Add a label tag to describe what
        the purpose of input field is. We can connect the
        label and input tags further by using a for attribute
        within the label tag and assigning the value of the
        input’s id to the for attribute. -->
		<input type="text" id="userName" name="userName" /><br>
        <!-- The input tag and text type display a field inside
		the browser that accepts text input inside it. -->
		<label for="nickname">Nick Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="nickname" name="nickname" /><br>
        <!-- We need the id attribute so that we can access what
        the user types in the form field using Javascript
        code. -->
		<label for="email">Email</label>
        <!-- Using email affects the keyboard that shows up
        when the user types in an input field.
        The mobile email optimized keyboard
        appears with an @ sign in the lower-right corner
        and allows the user to type email addresses faster. -->
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" /><br>
        <!-- The name attribute is
        used to label the value of its input tag when it’s
        sent to a back-end form processor. -->
		<label for="phone">Phone Number</label>
        <input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" /><br>
        <!-- Using tel for the value of the type
        attribute provides a keyboard optimized for
        phone numbers on mobile devices.  -->
		<label for="age">Age</label>
        <input type="number" id="age" name="age" min="0" max="150"/><br>
        <!-- The number type input gives our field an up and
        down arrow that we can use to increase or decrease
        the input value. -->
        <label for="dob">Date of Birth</label>
        <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob" /><br><br>
        <!-- The input type will be date which will present the
		user with a calendar from which they can choose a date. -->

          <!-- From the user interface in the browser, users can
			select one or more of those bands.
            The name attribute in the code contains
            the same value for each of the checkboxes in the
            set to ensure that the form processes
            correctly and work as a whole.-->
