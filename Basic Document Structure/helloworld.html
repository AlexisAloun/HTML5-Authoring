<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This is the document type definition. It simply identifies your document as an HTML5 document. (Technically, this is not actually HTML, but SGML Standard Generalized Markup Language, but let’s not get wrapped up in details) -->

<html>
<!-- The first html tag officially begins your HTML5 
code and the latter tag ends it. -->

<head>
<!-- This is the head section of the document.
It generally contains meta information (information about your document), scripts and links.
It can also contain CSS code. -->
<title> Basic Document Structure </title>
<!-- The title element contains the document title (obviously). The title has three purposes:
1. It’s used to label your document in browser
tab.
2. It’s used if your document is bookedmarked by the user
3. It’s used by search engines like Google™ to index your document and determine what your document is about. -->
</head>

<body>
<!-- This is the document body. This contains all the elements that appear in the document window. -->
<h1> Hello World from HTML5! </h1>
</body>

</html>
