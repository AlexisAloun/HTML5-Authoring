you want a number of <span> elements to be formatted the same way. The class "frame" can be used repeatedly in the code.-->
    
    <!-- The <div> tag starts a logical division. -->
    <div id="description" > <!-- the id uniquely identifies the logicial division. In fact, in well coded HTML the
value "description" could not be repeated in any other id. Itâ€™s meant to be a unique identifier. -->
