<h3>Famous Poem by AE Houseman</h3>
<p>With Rue My Heart is Laden <br/>
For golden friends I had, <br/>
For many a rose-lipt maiden <br/>
And many a lightfoot lad. <br/>
By brooks too broad for leaping <br/>
The lightfoot boys are laid; <br/>
The rose-lipt girls are sleeping <br/>
In fields where roses fade. <br/>
- AE Houseman </p>
