        <p>The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake <br>
        A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride<br>
        The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think<br>
        So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right<br>
        The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back<br>
        Yeah you can find us where the party's at</p></div>

    <p>My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to<br>
        Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small<br>
        You never need to carry more than you can hold<br>
        And while you're out there getting where you're getting to<br>
        I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too<br>
        Yeah, this, is my wish</p></div>
